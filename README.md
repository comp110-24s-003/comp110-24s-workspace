# COMP110 Workspace - Spring 2024

Your work in the course will be completed in this workspace. Instructions for the two most common tasks you'll perform can be found below.

## Backup Your Work

"Push" your work up to GitHub for backup. By creating "commits", which you can think of as versioned checkpoints in your workspace, you are not at risk of losing your work. It's easy to revert back to an old version or to restore your entire workspace on a different computer.

1. Select the _View_ menu and then _Source Control_
   - Alternatively: Select the Activity Bar icon that's three circles with lines connected for Source Control
2. Notice the files listed under "Changes". These are files you've made modifications to since your last backup.
3. Move your mouse's cursor over the word **Changes** and notice the + symbol that appears. Click that plus symbol to add all changes to the next backup. You will now see these listed under "Staged Changes".
   - If you do not want to backup _all_ changed files, you can select them individually. For this course you're encouraged to back everything up.
4. In the Message box, give a brief description of what you've changed and are backing up. This will help you find a specific backup (called a "commit") if needed.
5. Open the _View_ menu and select _Command Palette_, the shortcut for this menu is:
   - Windows: `Control+Shift+P`
   - Mac: `Command+Shift+P`
6. Begin typing in: `Git: Push to...` and press `Enter` once it is the first option.
7. Select the `backup` remote that is your personal workspace on GitHub. If you do not see `backup` listed, see the instructions below on _Setup Backup Course Material Repository_.
   - You may see a spinning "refresh" icon in your status bar at the bottom of VSCode. Unless an error backing up occurs, you will not see any confirmation.
   - If you want to see your backed up work on Github, navigate to the following URL but replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username:
   - `https://github.com/comp110-24f-003/comp110-workspace-24f-USERNAME`

## Download New Course Material

"Pulling" course materials down from Upstream. As new lesson material or starter code for exercises and projects is added to our central course repository, these are the steps you'll take to download them into your own workspace repository.

1. Open the _View_ menu and select _Command Palette_ 
   - The shortcut for this menu is:
   - Windows: `Control+Shift+P`
   - Mac: `Command+Shift+P`
2. Begin typing in `Git: Pull From...` and press `Enter` once it is the first option. 
3. Begin typing in `origin` and press `Enter` once it is the first option.
4. Press enter with `origin/main` as the first option.
5. This downloads the latest course materials! It will succeed silently, so if nothing appears to happen it worked (and any new files will be available in the file explorer). If there was an error, you would see an error message pop up.
6. If prompted to that "Configuration file(s) changed" always select "Rebuild" to rebuild your workspace with the latest features needed for the course. It take about a minute to update.
